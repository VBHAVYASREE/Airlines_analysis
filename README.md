#Airlines_Data_Analysis_Project
Goal of this Project would be to identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate on low-performing flights, which can ultimately lead to increased profitability for the airline.
   # Main Challenges
1. Stricter environmental regulations: The demand on the airlines industry
to decrease its carbon footprint is growing, which has resulted in more
stringent environmental laws that raise operating costs and restrict
expansion potential.
2. Higher flight taxes: To solve environmental issues and increase money,
governments all around the world are taxiing aircraft more heavily, which
raises the cost of flying and decreases demand.
3. Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs: The lack of
trained people in the aviation sector has increased labor costs and
increased turnover rates.
   # Objectives
1. Increase occupancy rate: By increasing the occupancy rate, we can
boost the average profit earned per seat and mitigate the impact of the
challenges we're facing.
2. Improve pricing strategy: We need to develop a pricing strategy that
takes into account the changing market conditions and customer
preferences to attract and retain customers.
3. Enhance customer experience: We need to focus on providing a
seamless and convenient experience for our customers, from booking to
arrival, to differentiate ourselves in a highly competitive industry and
increase customer loyalty.
The end goal of this task would be to identify opportunities to increase the
occupancy rate on low-performing flights, which can ultimately lead to increased
profitability for the airline.

To summarize, analyzing revenue data such as total revenue per year,
average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft is critical
for airlines seeking to maximize profitability. Airlines can find areas for
improvement and modify their pricing and route plans as a result of
assessing these indicators. A greater occupancy rate is one important
feature that can enhance profitability since it allows airlines to maximize
revenue while minimizing costs associated with vacant seats. The airline
should revise the price for each aircraft as the lower price and high price is
also the factor that people are not buying tickets from those aircrafts. They
should decide the reasonable price according to the condition and facility of
the aircraft and it should not be very cheap or high.
Furthermore, boosting occupancy rates should not come at the price of
consumer happiness or safety. Airlines must strike a balance between the
necessity for profit and the significance of delivering high-quality service
and upholding safety regulations. Airlines may achieve long-term success
in a highly competitive business by adopting a data-driven strategy to
revenue analysis and optimisation
